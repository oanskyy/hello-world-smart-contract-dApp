#3. Submitting/Publish your Smart Contract to Etherscan
submitting your smart contract's ABI to Etherscan so anyone can look at the contract's methods and variables and understand how to interact with it.
By verifying your smart contract on Etherscan, anyone can view your source code and interact with your smart contract

###

Steps:
**#1. Create and Deploy your Smart Contract using Hardhat**
**#2. Interacting with a Smart Contract**
**#3. Submitting a Smart Contract to Etherscan**
**#4. Integrating Your Smart Contract with the Frontend**

3.1 Generate an API key on your Etherscan account
3.2 Hardhat-deployed smart contracts
- install the hardhat-etherscan plugin
- verify your smart contract on Etherscan
3.3 Check out your contract on Etherscan

###

3.1 Generate an API key on your Etherscan account
An Etherscan API Key is necessary to verify that you're the owner of the smart contract that you're trying to publish

select the "My profile" button, navigate to the "API-KEYs" button on the left tab bar. Then press the "Add" button, name your app whatever you wish (we chose hello-world), and then select continue.

your .env file should look like this:
API_URL = "https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key"
API_KEY = "your-api-key"
PRIVATE_KEY = "your-private-account-address"
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = "your-etherscan-key"

3.2 Hardhat-deployed smart contracts
-- install the hardhat-etherscan plugin
Publishing your contract to Etherscan with HardHat is super simple. To get started, you will first need to install the hardhat-etherscan plugin to automatically verify your smart contract's source code and ABI on Etherscan. In your hello-world project directory run:
_npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan_

npm WARN deprecated @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan@3.1.8: The @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan package is deprecated, please use _@nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify instead_

-- verify your smart contract on Etherscan
Finally, run the verify task, passing the address of the contract and the first message argument string that we deployed it with:
*npx hardhat verify --network sepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS 'Hello World!'*

If all goes well, you should see the following message in your terminal: 
The contract 0xBd... has already been verified 

OR
Successfully submitted source code for contract
contracts/HelloWorld.sol:HelloWorld at 0xdeployed-contract-address
for verification on Etherscan. Waiting for verification result...

Successfully verified contract HelloWorld on Etherscan.
https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/<contract-address>#contracts

3.3 Check out your contract on Etherscan 
You should be able to see your smart contract code and ABI published on Etherscan!

Wahooo - you did it champ! Now, anyone can call or write to your smart contract!
